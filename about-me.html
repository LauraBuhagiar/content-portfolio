                    <p class="mt-6 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed text-justify">Ever since I was little, I've always been fascinated by stories. Movies, books, magazines, plays, anything you can think of. My eagerness and passion for words and literature eventually developed into a love for the theatre, music and dance; all different forms of storytelling in their own unique way.</p>
                    <p class="mt-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed text-justify">After years of performing others' words and ideas, I decided to try out a few of my own. I put the pen to paper and let the rest unfold.</p>

                    <p class="mt-6 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed text-justify">It started like it usually does-with reading and writing at school. I was thriving in English class and soon realised that this was more than just about my A grades and stellar exams results. Throughout the years, my fascination became with conveying people's experiences and lives to others, in whatever creative way that may be; choreography, writing poetry, composing music, improvisation. I started studying Communications at university but after a few months, decided to take the plunge and try out an acting career first. Funny thing is, I still found my way back to writing. Through my training as an actor, I understood that knowing someone's story wasn't enough. The way in which we told it, I learnt, was more pertinent than anything else and would result in captivating the minds of our audiences.</p>

                    <p class="mt-6 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed text-justify">I began writing scripts for my youth theatre company, telling stories that would resonate with listeners and viewers and, to no surprise I've been doing that ever since in various mediums. Script writing, monologues and speeches, short stories, advert scripts, as well as content creation and copy for my own little businesses. I realised telling stories infiltrated everything I did and was a huge part of my life. There's nothing more rewarding than bringing to life the experiences we see with our eyes and putting them into words for the rest of the world to take in.</p>
